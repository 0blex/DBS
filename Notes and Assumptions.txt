Calculating productivity for vairable FixtureType

UID	EquipmentID	BathNo	RunNumber	NthTag	WO	LeachDepth	FixtureType	WO_ITEM		WO_Quantity	WO_Releach	ProductSize

This particular run looked unsual to me as the FixtureType was not consistent for the all items in the run. This is the only instantance of this happening. 

As a result there are two plausible ways to calculate productivity:
- calculate the productivity of a run by summing the productivity of each individual NthTag within the run. Productivity of run = SUM( Productivity of each NthTag )
- calculate productivity based on the smallest capacity of the NthTags. Productivity of run = SUM( WO_Quantity ) / MIN(BathCapacity)

Took the assumption that if one fixture type reduces the BathCapacity for one NthTag then it reduces the capacity of the overall bath. Therefore the latter calculation was used:
Productivity of run = SUM( WO_Quantity ) / MIN(BathCapacity)

This assumption only affected 1 run.


ASSUMPTION:
Productivity greater than 1

There were two runs where the WO_Quantity was greater than the BathCapacity. 
Assumed to be plausible and included in the analysis.

EquipmentID	BathNo	RunNumber	Productivity
ACLS_Wetbench_1	3	10		1.03448275862069
ACLS_Wetbench_1	7	20		1.03333333333333


NOTES:

Included both 'Completed' and 'Running' statuses in calculation of productivity as even if the process fails or otherwise it will still have been productive in that period.
A separate analysis would be expected to look at process failure rates.

There was a run were the StopTime was greater than the Endtime. This is not possible. For this purpose the record was excluded
Runid = ACLS_Wetbench_2 | 7 | 4
